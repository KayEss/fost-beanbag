 The JSON DBs backed to disk must be created with a `boost::filesystem::wpath` instance, not from a `fostlib::string`.

2012-03-15  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 The JSON database `remove` command now makes sure that the object being removed is the same when it runs against the actual database. This makes the remove much safer as the transaction will fail if another transaction has altered the data.

 Model initialisation
 - There is now an explicit type for the parameter used to initialise
   a model instance. This will allow the available information to be
   extended in a sane manner.
