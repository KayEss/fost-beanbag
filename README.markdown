# Beanbag -- A lightweight JSON database  0.0 #

Beanbag is a very lightweight ACID compliant transactional JSON database. The database itself is one or more JSON files and you interact with it through RESTful calls.

It's all very experimental so probably best used for fun rather than profit.

# Using Beanbag #

There is no release yet, so you'll need to checkout the develop branch and try from there. After checking out develop re-read this file.

# Development #

This project uses git flow. Don't forget to do `git flow init -d` after you clone it.
