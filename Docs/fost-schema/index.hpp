    \brief fost-schema is the lowest most layer of the OR/M part of Fost 4. It is responsible for handling the abstractions of the databases themselves.

    Modelling is split into both dynamic and static kinds. Dynamic models can be defined at run time, whilst static models are defined at compile time -- they have a C++ class that represents the model itself and attributes that are directly accessible through C++ syntax. Static models can however be augmented at run time.
