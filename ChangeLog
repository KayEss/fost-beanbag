 Can now set up an alias for a given database so the same underlying database can be referred to by more than one name.

 If there is no HTML content given then return a JSON response for the request.

2012-08-02  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Allow the database to be fetched through a virtual method so it can be overridden.
 There is no reason why converting a path to a jcursor should require the database so remove it from the method signature.

 Moved the database header so that other code can also access beanbags directly without needing to go through the web server.

2012-03-02  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Allow PUT to be done at a new position in the JSON. Objects and arrays will be created as needed to accommodate the new data at the requested location.
 Any query string at all will force JSON response (as text/plain for now). For future compatibility use __ as the query string key. I.e. http://localhost:8080/?__=
